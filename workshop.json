{"workshopId":1885669268,"Title":"Reroll Ray","Description":"This mod adds the reconjugation pistol. Hitting anything with the pistol's projectile will reconfigure reality in a localized pocket around it, refreshing its existence. What could the Eaters have used this for?\n\nBe careful, Moon King! Getting hit by the pistol yourself would likely not be a pleasant experience, so it may be wise to avoid offering it for your companions' use.\n\nThanks to TBExtent for the pistol's description.\n\nOfficial repository: https://github.com/HeladoDeBrownie/Caves-of-Qud-Reroll-Ray","Tags":"scripting","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
