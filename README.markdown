This mod adds the `reconjugation pistol`. Hitting anything with the pistol's projectile will reconfigure reality in a localized pocket around it, refreshing its existence. What could the Eaters have used this for?

Be careful, Moon King! Getting hit by the pistol yourself would likely not be a pleasant experience, so it may be wise to avoid offering it for your companions' use.

Thanks to TBExtent for the pistol's description.
